## xxHash [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nashby/xxhash.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nashby/xxhash)

Ruby wrapper for [xxHash](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash)

### Compatability
- Does not work with JRuby ( since this uses C code ) . See [C-Extension-Alternatives](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/wiki/C-Extension-Alternatives) for more information

### Install

    gem install xxhash

### Usage

```ruby
require 'xxhash'

text = "test"
seed = 12345

XXhash.xxh32(text, seed) # => 3834992036
```

If you do not provide a seed, it will use the default value `0`.

You can use it with `IO` objects too:

```ruby
XXhash.xxh32_stream(StringIO.new('test'), 123) # => 2758658570
```

Note that you can also pass a chunk size as third param (it's 32 bytes by default)

XXH64 is also supported: you can use `xxh64` and `xxh64_stream`.

### Supported Ruby versions

- MRI 1.9.3, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 & 2.3.
- rbx-19mode

Note: It doesn't work on JRuby as it uses C extension.

### Versioning

Version 0.4.0 is equal to [0.6.2](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/tree/v0.6.2)
