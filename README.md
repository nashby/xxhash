## xxHash [![Ruby](https://github.com/nashby/xxhash/actions/workflows/ruby.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nashby/xxhash/actions/workflows/ruby.yml)

Ruby wrapper for [xxHash](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash)

### Install

    gem install xxhash

### Usage

```ruby
require 'xxhash'

text = "test"
seed = 12345

XXhash.xxh32(text, seed) # => 3834992036
```

If you do not provide a seed, it will use the default value `0`.

You can use it with `IO` objects too:

```ruby
XXhash.xxh32_stream(StringIO.new('test'), 123) # => 2758658570
```

You can use it with file path directly, avoiding costly ruby-related operations.

```ruby
XXhash.xxh32_file(__FILE__)
```

Note that you can also pass a chunk size as third param (it's 32 bytes by default)

XXH64 is also supported: you can use `xxh64`, `xxh64_stream`, `.xxh64_file`.

### Supported Ruby versions

- MRI 3.1+

Note: It doesn't work on JRuby as it uses C extension.

### Versioning

Version 0.5.0 is equal to [0.6.2](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/tree/v0.6.2)
